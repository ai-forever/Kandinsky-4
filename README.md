# Kandinsky-4: Text-to-Video diffusion model

## How to use:
```python
import torch
from IPython.display import Video
from kandinsky import get_T2V_pipeline

device_map = {
    "dit": torch.device('cuda:0'), 
    "vae": torch.device('cuda:0'), 
    "text_embedder": torch.device('cuda:0')
}

pipe = get_T2V_pipeline(device_map)

images = pipe(
    seed=42,
    time_length=12,
    width = 672,
    height = 384,
    save_path="./mammoths.mp4",
    text="Several giant wooly mammoths approach treading through a snowy meadow, their long wooly fur lightly blows in the wind as they walk, snow covered trees and dramatic snow capped mountains in the distance",
)

Video("./mammoths.mp4")
```

Examples of usage and more detailed parameters description are in the [examples.ipynb](examples.ipynb) notebook.

Make sure that you have weights folder with weights of all models.

We also add distributed inference opportunity: [run_inference_distil.py](run_inference_distil.py)

To run this examples:
```
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nnodes n --nproc-per-node m run_inference_distil.py
```
where n is a number of nodes you have and m is a number of gpus on these nodes. The code was tested with n=1 and m=8, so this is preferable parameters.

In distributed setting the DiT models are parallelized using tensor parallel on all gpus, which enables a significant speedup.

To run this examples from terminal without tensor parallel:
```
python run_inference_distil.py
```
